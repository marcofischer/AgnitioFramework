		<p>All pages in a presentation are referred to as <strong>slides</strong>, and those slides are always part of a <strong>slideshow</strong>, but slideshows can optionally be combined into <strong>collections</strong> where each slideshow then become a <strong>section</strong> (chapter) in that collection.</p>
		<p>An <strong>inline slideshow</strong> is a slideshow displayed inside of a slide.</p>
		<p>Sections of a collection are often referred to as <strong>chapters</strong>.</p>
		<p><strong>Core modules</strong> are the inner workings of the framework, and are only edited by framework developers. The <strong>Slideshow</strong> core module is an example.</p>
		<p><strong>Modules</strong> are packaged code with a specific functionality beyond the scope of a single slide. An example is a thumbnail navigation module.</p>
		<p><strong>Assets</strong> are reusable code affecting a single slide, i.e. an animated pie chart.</p>
