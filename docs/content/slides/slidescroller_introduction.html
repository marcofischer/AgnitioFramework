		<h2 class="slideHeader">Introduction to module: Slidescroller</h2>
    <p>The Slidescroller module listens for swipe events and will scroll to the appropriate slide or section. The constructor can be used to create as many scrollers as needed but in most presentations one should be enough.</p>
    
    <p>This module can easily be replaced or removed if other behavior is desired, no core component of the framework requires it (although other custom modules may).</p>
    
    <h3>Convention</h3>
    <p>In Agnitio we use the following convention for creating our main scroller (for slideshows and sections): <code>app.scroller = new Slidescroller();</code>. In some of our modules, i.e. SlidePopup, we use the <code>app.scroller</code> object to disable and enable scrolling. When using Agnitio modules it is encouraged to follow the above convention.</p>
