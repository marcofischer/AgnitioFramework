		<p>
		  The framework provides organization, libraries, and most importantly an API for building several types of presentations/slideshows. It is modular, meaning that it is easy to plug in and reuse modules/assets. The modular nature and folder/file organization also makes it easy for several developers working on the same presentation at the same time.

		<h3>Examples of presentation types</h3>
		<ul>
		  <li>Simple slideshow</li>
      <li>Multiple slideshows</li>
      <li>Collection with sections</li>
      <li>Multiple slideshows with and without sections</li>
      <li>Dynamic slideshows</li>
    </ul>
